# Stackdriver Service Monitoring

## Backend

Using the `StackdriverServiceMonitoring` backend class, you can use the
`Stackdriver Service Monitoring API` to manage your SLOs.

SLOs are created from standard metrics available in Stackdriver Monitoring and
the data is stored in `Stackdriver Service Monitoring API` (see
  [docs](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/service-monitoring/using-api)).

The following methods are available to compute SLOs with the `Stackdriver`
backend:

* `basic` to create standard SLOs for Google App Engine, Google Kubernetes
Engine, and Cloud Endpoints.
* `good_bad_ratio` for metrics of type `DELTA` or `CUMULATIVE`.
* `distribution_cut` for metrics of type `DELTA` and unit `DISTRIBUTION`.

### Basic

The `basic` method is used to let the `Stackdriver Service Monitoring API`
automatically generate standardized SLOs for the following GCP services:
* **Google App Engine**
* **Google Kubernetes Engine** (with Istio)
* **Google Cloud Endpoints**

The SLO configuration uses Stackdriver
[GCP metrics](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/metrics_gcp) and only
requires minimal configuration compared to custom SLOs.

**Example config (App Engine availability):**

```yaml
backend:
  class:            StackdriverServiceMonitoring
  method:           basic
  project_id:       ${STACKDRIVER_HOST_PROJECT_ID}
  measurement:
    app_engine:
      project_id:   ${GAE_PROJECT_ID}
      module_id:    ${GAE_MODULE_ID}
    availability:   {}
```

spec.

```

    latency:
      threshold:         500 # ms
```

### Good / bad ratio

The `good_bad_ratio` method is used to compute the ratio between two metrics:

- **Good events**, i.e events we consider as 'good' from the user perspective.
- **Bad or valid events**, i.e events we consider either as 'bad' from the user
perspective, or all events we consider as 'valid' for the computation of the
SLO.

This method is often used for availability SLOs, but can be used for other
purposes as well (see examples).

**Example config:**
```yaml
backend:
  class:          StackdriverServiceMonitoring
  project_id:     ${STACKDRIVER_HOST_PROJECT_ID}
  method:         good_bad_ratio
  measurement:
    filter_good:  >
      project="${GAE_PROJECT_ID}"
      metric.type="appengine.googleapis.com/http/server/response_count"
      resource.type="gae_app"
      metric.labels.response_code >= 200
      metric.labels.response_code < 500
    filter_valid: >
      project="${GAE_PROJECT_ID}"
      metric.type="appengine.googleapis.com/http/server/response_count"
```

You can also use the `filter_bad` field which identifies bad events instead of
the `filter_valid` field which identifies all valid events.

## Distribution cut

The `distribution_cut` method is used for Stackdriver distribution-type metrics,
which are usually used for latency metrics.

A distribution metric records the **statistical distribution of the extracted
values** in **histogram buckets**. The extracted values are not recorded
individually, but their distribution across the configured buckets are recorded,
along with the `count`, `mean`, and `sum` of squared deviation of the values.

**Example config:**

```yaml
backend:
  class:          StackdriverServiceMonitoring
  project_id:     ${STACKDRIVER_HOST_PROJECT_ID}
  method:         distribution_cut
  measurement:
    filter_valid: >
      project=${GAE_PROJECT_ID}
      metric.type=appengine.googleapis.com/http/server/response_latencies
      metric.labels.response_code >= 200
      metric.labels.response_code < 500
    range_min:    0
    range_max:    724 # ms
```

The `range_min` and `range_max` are used to specify the latency range that we
consider 'good'.

## Service Monitoring API considerations

### Tracking objects
Since `Stackdriver Service Monitoring API` persists `Service` and
`ServiceLevelObjective` objects, we need ways to keep our local SLO YAML
configuration synced with the remote objects.

**Auto-imported**

Some services are auto-imported by the `Service Monitoring API`: they correspond
to SLO configurations using the [`basic`](#basic) method.

The following conventions are used by the `Service Monitoring API` to give a
unique id to an auto-imported `Service`:

  * **App Engine:**

    ```
    gae:{project_id}_{module_id}
    ```
    &rightarrow; *Make sure that the `app_engine` block in your config has the
    correct fields corresponding to your App Engine service.*

  * **Cloud Endpoints:**

    ```
    ist:{project_id}-{service}
    ```
    &rightarrow; *Make sure that the `cloud_endpoints` block in your config has
    the correct fields corresponding to your Cloud Endpoint service.*

  * **Mesh Istio [NOT YET RELEASED]:**

    ```
    ist:{project_id}-{mesh_uid}-{service_namespace}-{service_name}
    ```
    &rightarrow; *Make sure that the `mesh_istio` block in your config has the
    correct fields corresponding to your Istio service.*

  * **Cluster Istio [DEPRECATED SOON]:**

    ```
    ist:{project_id}-zone-{location}-{cluster_name}-{service_namespace}-{service_name}
    ```
    &rightarrow; *Make sure that the `cluster_istio` block in your config has
    the correct fields corresponding to your Istio service.*

You cannot import an existing `ServiceLevelObjective` object, since they use a
random id.

**Custom**

Custom services are the ones you create yourself using the
`Service Monitoring API` and the `slo-generator`.

The following conventions are used by the `slo-generator` to give a unique id
to a custom `Service` and `Service Level Objective` objects:

* `service_id = ${service_name}-${feature_name}`

* `slo_id = ${service_name}-${feature_name}-${slo_name}-${window}`

To keep track of those, **do not update any of the following fields** in your
configs:

  * `service_name`, `feature_name` and `slo_name` in the SLO config.

  * `window` in the Error Budget Policy.

If you need to make updates to any of those fields, first run the
`slo-generator` with the `-d` (delete) option (see
  [#deleting-objects](#deleting-objects)), then re-run normally.

To import an existing custom `Service` objects, find out your service id from
the API and fill the `service_id` in the SLO configuration.

You cannot import an existing custom `ServiceLevelObjective` unless it complies
to the naming convention.

### Deleting objects

To delete an SLO object in `Stackdriver Monitoring API` using the
`StackdriverServiceMonitoringBackend` class, run the `slo-generator` with the
`-d` (or `--delete`) flag:

```
slo-generator -f <SLO_CONFIG_PATH> -b <ERROR_BUDGET_POLICY> --delete
```

## Alerting

See the Stackdriver Service Monitoring [docs](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/service-monitoring/alerting-on-budget-burn-rate)
